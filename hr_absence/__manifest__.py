"version": "18.0.1.0.0",
"summary": "Compute perâ€‘day/shift absence and show it next to HR Attendance",
"description": """
Adds a lightweight daily/shift "dayline" for each employee so you can see:
- hr_absence / Present / Partial per day
- Expected vs attended minutes, lateness, early checkout
- Smart button on Employee to open Daylines
- Menu under Attendances to review and filter hr_absence


Designed to play nicely with existing biometric processing that writes hr.attendance.
You can set your working timezone in user preferences. Defaults to Asia/Riyadh.
